    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong> Adds thickness and zest.</li>
        <li><strong>Kidney Beans:</strong> They're just beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Chili Beans:</strong> Also just beans... but different.</li>
        <li><strong>Chili Powder:</strong> Gives that flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Black Pepper:</strong> Season to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
